# Smart-Water-Meter
Industrial Project for AUT

These are codes that I have created for my final year industrial project at AUT University.

I have setup a Raspberry Pi based LAMP server to use as my webserver to store and view data collected from the smart water meter device.

The smart water meter consists of two devices. one to collect the pulse count from the water meter and one to upload the data to the server via wifi.
The devices use HC-12 rf transceiver to communicate with each other, the collector uses attiny85 microcontroller and the uploader uses ESP-12E.

Please read the Smart Water Meter Report for more detailed analysis of this project.

Thank you
